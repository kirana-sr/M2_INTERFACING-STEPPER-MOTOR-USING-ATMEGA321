# REQUIREMENTS

Stepper Motors are DC brushless vehicles that could rotate from zero to 
360 in steps. Stepper motor makes use of digital alerts to rotate the motor 
in steps and every sign rotates the shaft in constant increment (one step). 
The interfacing stepper motor using ATmega328 is one of automation for 
clock wise and then it rotate anticlock wise direction 
The ULN2001 sensor is called DARLINGTON Transistor Arrays which is 
used to drive the motor and it drive the high current load like opamp gates 
etc. 
The rotation angel is managed with the aid of using making use of positive
series of signals. Unlike Servo Motor, stepper cars may be pushed with the 
aid of using the usage of GPIO pins of microcontroller in place of PWM pins 
and might rotate in (+360) and (-360). 
The order of indicators makes a decision the clockwise and counter 
clockwise route of stepper motor. To manipulate the rate of the motor, we 
simply want to extrade the price of manipulate indicators applied. The 
stepper automobiles rotates in steps. 
There are numerous modes of steps to function Stepper Motor along with
complete step, 1/2 of step and micro step. We will interface 28BYJ-forty 
eight Stepper Motor with Atmega328 AVR Microcontroller the use of Atmel 
Studio 7.0. 
The stepper motor is rated to paintings in 5V. We can be interfacing the 
stepper motor with each the motor drivers i.e. ULN2008. Both can be
pushed with the aid of using 5V supply. In order to simplify the interfacing 
we're the use of prebuild module of each motor drivers. We also can use 
ULN2003 and L293D standalone ICâ€™s. The wide variety of wires and 
jumpers may be more, so simply be cautious at the same time as
connecting all of the connections.
A stepper motor is a form of DC motor that rotates in steps. When electric
sign is implemented to it, the motor rotates in steps and the velocity of 
rotation relies upon at the charge at which the electric indicators are 
implemented and the route of rotation is depending on the sample of pulses 
this is followed.
INTERFACING STEPPER MOTOR USING ATMEGA328 
A stepper motor is made from a rotor, that's usually a everlasting magnet 
and it is, because the call indicates the rotating element of the motor. A 
stator is some other component that's with inside the shape of winding. In 
the diagram below, the centre is the rotor that's surrounded with the aid of 
using the stator winding. This is referred to as 4 section windinG
