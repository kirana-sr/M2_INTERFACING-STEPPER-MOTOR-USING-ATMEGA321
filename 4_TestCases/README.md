Test cases for Stepper Motor:
  1. verify the stepper Motor converts electronic pulse into mechanical movement
  2. verify if the motor should maintain torgue indifinitely when rotor is stopped without burnig up motor winding
  3. The motive force is efficiently sized for the motor
  4.any segment modern settings are correct (possibly a easy motive force constantly makes use of max)
    the loading of the motor would not exceed the torque calculated through segment modern
  5.The step anle should be 45 digree check the step angle of stepper motor
  6.verify all requirement of the project
  
  Test cases for ATMEGA328:
  1 verify the atmega328 if work  properly
  2.check it send signal propely to ULN2001 SERVER
  3.Check the specification
  4 check if its work for autonomous systems
  5. verify the serial programing
  
  Test cases for ULN2001:
  1.check the rating
  2.verify the pin configuration
  3.check its work on high current and 500mA and output voltage 50v
  
  Test cases for switch:
  1.confirm the ration
  2.check if working are not properly 
  
  Test cases for resistor:
  1. check rating according to the requirement
  2. check the function of resister
