WORKING 
Stepper motor is a brushless DC motor that divides the total rotation attitude of 
360° into some of identical steps. 
 • The motor is turned around through making use of a sure series of manipulate
alerts. The pace of rotation may be modified through converting the fee at which 
the manipulate alerts are applied.

• Various stepper cars with one-of-a-kind step angles and torque rankings are to be 
had with inside the market. 
 • A microcontroller may be used to use one-of-a-kind manipulate alerts to the 
motor to make it rotate consistent with the want of the application. 
• Here we're going to interface 6 wires Unipolar Stepper Motor with ATmega32 
controller 
. • Only 4 wires are required to manipulate the stepper motor. Two not unusual 
place wires of stepper motor related to 5V supply 
• ULN2003 driving force is used to the using stepper motor. 
 • Note that to recognize winding coil and their middle faucet leads degree
resistance in among leads. From middle leads, we are able to get 1/2 of the 
resistance price of that winding
